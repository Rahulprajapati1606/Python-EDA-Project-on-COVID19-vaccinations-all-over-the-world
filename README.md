# Python-EDA-Project-on-COVID19-vaccinations-all-over-the-world
PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of COVID-19 vaccinations worldwide. The aim is to understand global vaccination trends, compare vaccination rollouts across countries, and explore the types and effects of different vaccines.

PROJECT SCOPE:
Loaded and cleaned a global COVID-19 vaccination dataset using Pandas, handling missing values and preparing the data for analysis.

Explored dataset structure and statistics using .info(), .describe(), and visual inspection of rows and columns.

Analyzed total vaccinations across countries to identify top performers in vaccination rollout.

Compared people who received at least one dose vs. those fully vaccinated across different nations.

Investigated daily vaccination trends and categorized them based on the type of vaccine used per country.

Used normalized metrics like vaccinations per hundred and daily vaccinations per million to compare countries fairly regardless of population size.

Visualized key metrics using bar plots and line plots for easier interpretation and presentation.

Highlighted which vaccines were dominant in high-performing countries.

Drew meaningful insights into global vaccination efforts, trends, and disparities in rollout speed and vaccine types.

Set the foundation for further statistical modeling or forecasting based on vaccination trends.
